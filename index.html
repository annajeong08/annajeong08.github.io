<p>My partners Tianna, Jessenia, and I made this game using inspiration from Super Mario. It took quite a while, drawing the backdrops and other sprites, as well as coding the game to ressemble somewhat of a Super Mario feel. The most difficult part was being able to use cloning correctly, which was necessary for creating a side-scrolling game.</p>
